I analyze brain MRI scans from kaggle--datasets(~97% accuracy on evaluation)

Simple convolutional net with efficient-net as backbone(least params and inference time in efficient-net family)

*MobileNet performed noticeably worse(or else, it's size and params are half of that of eff-net/ and, inference time)

Minimal(*not freezing deeper layers in backbone could surprisingly have decreased model depth?)


## Meningioma(ex.)
